## A React test study
This project comes from the course <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/react-testing-library/" target="_blank">React Testing Library with Jest/Vitest by Bonnie Schulkin</a>.
Its server is all coded by the instructor, and the frontend layout is also. 

Here the main focus was to study and practice the unit and functional testing of a frontend project in ReactJS.
